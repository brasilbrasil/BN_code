process spp data3.r is the main script that connects nearly all functionality of this repository

Here are the options of the main script:

categorize.GIS.data #If true, runs categorize5.R scripts. This is the script that creates the thresholds for the different factors
                    #and applies it to the data to create the state-based version of each factor considered.

plot_hist #If categorizing data (categorize.GIS.data==T), this switch controls whether histograms of all model
          #variables will be created, with the breakpoints for the categories ploted along
          # creates figures for appendix 5

calc_priors #If true, runs calc priors.R. This script will simply use the data across all species 
            #to calculate the mean state frequency for each factor

create_factor_mean_table #creates table 2 for report

add.spp.to.GeNIe.model # this step could reasonably be skipped. This essentially inputs the factor states into the genie model 
                       #based on the available data for a given species of interest

create.catnet.model #Creates catnet version of GeNIe model

calculate.conditional.ps # Calculates posterior probabilities for species. This is the core of this repository

The scripts below do a lot of the outputs for synthesizing the data

merge_all_results_and_data #This script merges all posterior Ps, factors states, along with all original data into single file

do_tables #This generates multiple tables from results including several in report (e.g., table 3-6)

expert_comparison #this creates model vs expert comparison figure (Fig. 2)

do_correl_analyses #does correlation figures 16-17

create_response_histograms #does response histograms (Appendix 6). This is similar to plot_hist above but does the histograms
                           #for the dependent variables such as overall vulnerability and the underlying response posteriors

vulnerability_contrasts #does all group comparisons and related figures (Figs 10-13)

NECESSARY FILES:
data.file <- "allspp.csv"
## This file is the raw data for each species. The column "sp_name" should
## contain a unique identifier for each species. There may be a sample
## species data file "all_spp_values.xlsx" in which I change the names
## of the many "Unknown" species to "Unknown" with a number, and change
## some spaces in column names to underscores before saving it as a
## .csv file. Some further processing of the data is done in "categorize.R"

variables.file <- "variables.csv" #The necessary columns are described in variables_file_description.txt
## a table of variables in the datafile linking them to nodes
## in the GeNiE model. It also contains space for parameters to
## specify which quantiles to use in assigning categories
## (default is to use median for two categories, 1st and 3rd
## quartiles for 3 categories)

sppinterest.file <- "spinterest.csv"
## a table with a column "Species" containing the species we
## want to add cases for. GeNIe bogs down with too many cases, and
## sometimes we'll only want updates for a subset of species

model.file <- "conceptual_model05_unknownfactors_equalweights_priors_thirddispersion.xdsl"
## the GeNiE model to use when analyzing the data, and to use as
## a source when creating the catnet version in R

model.file.in <- "conceptual_model05_unknownfactors_equalweights_priors_thirddispersion_template.xdsl"
## A sample model file to use when adding cases to the GeNIe model.
## I usually generate this by deleting all cases from the current
## model after deleting all but a single case (which I re-name to
## "delete me" to avoid species name collisions)
## Right now the code needs a blank, unpopulated GeNiE model
## with a single placeholder case
